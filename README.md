Hello Everyone, With this program you can manage your library, you can add and remove books, list all the books, count the books.

Books.txt will be created upon start, it'll be our database.

Each book contains 4 key information: Title, author, release year and page count. Within list function you will only see title and author.

There is an interactive menu without gui, but it is simple and usable.

This project is made by me for Global Ai Hub Python Bootcamp.
